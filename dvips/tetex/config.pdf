% This is a config file for dvips 5.85(k) and teTeX, which is
% meant to produce PostScript optimized for distilling to PDF.
% Experimental. Created 12 Apr 1999 by tvz@nwu.edu; public domain.

% Changes by te, Sun May 16 20:41:16 CEST 1999:
%    - removed papersize stuff
%    - changed "o" line

% Memory available: The default for Distiller 3.0x is 8meg.
% Reduce to be on safe side:

m 6000000

% Default is to save output as file.
% If possible, change this so that it pipes output to distiller.
% If not, use command line ``-o file'' option to change name
% of output file.

o

% Default resolution. Attempt to make `resolution independent'.
% Resolution set to 8000dpi (could be as high as 10000).

D 8000

% This is for using BlueSky/AMS/Y&Y Type 1 fonts. Change this for other
% Type 1 fonts.

p psfonts_t1.map

% Last resort sizes.
% If you accidentally include a bitmapped pk font, it will probably go
% at 600dpi.

R 300 600

% Partial Type1 font downloading. This will happen by default. Uncomment
% this is you want to download entire fonts. NOT RECOMMENDED.

% j0

% Character shifting.  You may have wanted to do this when using the
% BlueSky/AMS/Y&Y fonts, a long time ago, to work around various
% bugs in ancient versions of Acrobat Reader, but it should no longer
% be necessary. It remaps certain ``control character'' positions to
% another range where these characters are repeated.
%
% Since this is doing more harm than good, it is disabled by default.
%
% G

% Switching algorithm for drawing rules. texc.pro is loaded by default,
% but the h tex.pro is need so that it comes before the patch. See
% below for more details.

h tex.pro
h alt-rule.pro
