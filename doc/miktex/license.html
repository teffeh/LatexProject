is freely redistributable (libre, that is, not necessarily gratis),
within the Free Software Foundation's definition and Debian Free
Software Guidelines.  If you find any non-free files included, please
contact us (references given below).</p><p>That said, <span class="application">MiKTeX</span> has neither a single copyright holder nor a
single license covering its entire contents, since it is a collection
of many disparate packages.  Therefore, you may copy, modify, and/or
redistribute software from <span class="application">MiKTeX</span> only if you comply with the
requirements placed thereon by the owners of the respective
packages.</p><p>To most easily learn these requirements, we suggest checking the
<span class="application">TeX</span> Catalogue at: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/catalogue.html" target="_top">http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/catalogue.html</a>
(or any <acronym class="acronym">CTAN</acronym> mirror).  The Catalogue is also included in <span class="application">MiKTeX</span> in
./texmf/doc/html/catalogue/, but the online version will have updates.
Of course the legal statements within the packages themselves are the
final authority.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id509416"></a>GUIDELINES FOR REDISTRIBUTION</h2></div></div></div><p>In general, you may redistribute <span class="application">MiKTeX</span>, with or without
modification, for profit or not, according to the usual free software
tenets.  Here are some general guidelines for doing this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>If you make any changes to the <span class="application">MiKTeX</span> distribution
or any package it contains, besides complying with any licensing
requirements, you must prominently mention such changes in your
modified distribution so that users do not take your work for ours,
and know to contact you, not us, in case of questions or problems.  A
new top-level README.<em class="replaceable"><code>yourwork</code></em> file is a
good place to describe the general situation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Especially (but not necessarily) if changes or
additions are made, we recommend a clearly different title, such as
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote"><em class="replaceable"><code>Your work</code></em>, based on <span class="application">MiKTeX</span>
<em class="replaceable"><code>x.y.zzzz</code></em> (with updates)</span>&#8221;</span>, where
<em class="replaceable"><code>x.y.zzzz</code></em> is the version of <span class="application">MiKTeX</span> you are
publishing.  This credits both our work and yours.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You absolutely may <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> place your
own copyright on the entire distribution, since it is not your work
(as stated above, <span class="application">MiKTeX</span> is not created by any single person or
entity).  Statements such as <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">all rights reserved</span>&#8221;</span> and
<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">may not be reproduced</span>&#8221;</span> are especially reprehensible,
since they are antithetical to the free software principles under
which <span class="application">MiKTeX</span> is produced.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You may use any cover or media label designs that you
wish.  Such packaging and marketing details are not covered by any
<span class="application">MiKTeX</span> license.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Finally, we make the following requests (not legal
requirements):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a"><li class="listitem"><p>Acknowledging that <span class="application">MiKTeX</span> is developed as a joint
effort by all <span class="application">TeX</span> user groups, and encouraging the user/reader to join
their user group of choice.</p><p>The web page <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tug.org/usergroups.html" target="_top">http://www.tug.org/usergroups.html</a>
may be referenced as a list of <span class="application">TeX</span> user groups.  We also appreciate
your explicitly listing all the user groups as given on that page,
space permitting.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Referencing the <span class="application">MiKTeX</span> home page: <a class="ulink" href="http://miktex.org/" target="_top">http://miktex.org/</a>.</p></li></ol></div><p>Such credits may be placed on the label of your media, your
cover, and/or in accompanying text (for instance, in the
acknowledgements section of a book).</p></li></ul></div><p>Finally, although it is certainly not a requirement, we'd like
to invite any redistributors to make a donation to the project,
whether cash or in-kind, for example via
<a class="ulink" href="http://miktex.org/giveback" target="_top">http://miktex.org/giveback</a>.  Thanks.</p><p>If you have any questions or comments, please contact us.  In
general, we appreciate being given the chance to review any
<span class="application">MiKTeX</span>-related material in advance of publication, simply to avoid
mistakes.  It is much better to correct text on a CD label or in a
book before thousands of copies are made!</p><p>We are also happy to keep anyone planning a publication informed
as to our deadlines and progress.  Just let us know.  However, you
should be aware that <span class="application">MiKTeX</span> is produced entirely by volunteers, and
no dates can be guaranteed.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id507354"></a>REFERENCES</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="application">MiKTeX</span> project page: <a class="ulink" href="http://miktex.org/" target="_top">http://miktex.org/</a></p><p>The <acronym class="acronym">FSF</acronym>'s free software definition:
