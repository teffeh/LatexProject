These allow you to easily highlight text and add comments in the margin. Vim escape sequences are provided for inserting these LaTeX commands in the source. The package is based on code for a text highlighting command that was published by Antal S-Z in href='http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5959'. The main file, proofread.dtx, is self-extracting, so you can generate the style file by compiling proofread.dtx with pdfLaTeX.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="5811">texmf\tex\latex\proofread\proofread.sty texmf\tpm\packages\proofread.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="225238">texmf\doc\latex\proofread\proofread.pdf texmf\doc\latex\proofread\README texmf\doc\latex\proofread\README.txt</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="7063">texmf\source\proofread-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1449571198</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>5ff469d9441c0b2300ca528fa2839c31</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/proofread"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
