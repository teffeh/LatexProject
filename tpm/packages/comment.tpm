All text between \comment ... \endcomment or \begin{comment} ... \end{comment} is discarded. The opening and closing commands should appear on a line of their own. No starting spaces, nothing after it. This environment should work with arbitrary amounts of comment, and the comment can be arbitrary text. Other ‘comment’ environments are defined and selected/deselected with \includecomment{versiona} and \excludecoment{versionb} These environments are used as \versiona … \endversiona or \begin{versiona} … \end{versiona} with the opening and closing commands again on a line of their own.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="11336">texmf\tex\latex\comment\comment.sty texmf\tpm\packages\comment.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="259565">texmf\doc\latex\comment\comment.pdf texmf\doc\latex\comment\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="3119">texmf\source\comment-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1390597201</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>3d6c444e41ddddaf772d4ed861a565c6</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/comment"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Victor Eijkhout" year="1998-2009"/><TPM:License type="gpl"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
