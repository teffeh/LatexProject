The exercise data are generated when running LaTeX on your document; the first run also writes the solutions to a secondary file that may be included in a simple document harness, may be processed by LaTeX, to generate a nice solution book. The code of the package was derived (in large part) from fancyvrb.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="9646">texmf\tex\latex\exsol\exsol.sty texmf\tpm\packages\exsol.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="257292">texmf\doc\latex\exsol\exsol.pdf texmf\doc\latex\exsol\LICENSE</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="9006">texmf\source\exsol-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1410206402</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>6b2d545bf6fad513b69874d82dffa789</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/exsol"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Walter Daems" year="2012-2014"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
